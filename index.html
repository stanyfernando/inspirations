The wage of sin is death

Ill humour in the morning brings about a darkened day

Flooding out our forbearers

We may never pass this way again

Until you blithe

Let it slip away

Knock on door

Starting to crack

Today's no day to fall apart

No one dares to find

Sleep with one eye open

Alone out on that open road

When love becomes a sacrifice

As heavens starts to cry Angel waves goodbye

Children of the wind

Sailing toward the setting sun

Out run the rain

Keep my reflection from your skin I'll keep my distance from the wind

Eyes that won't explore

Leave the mask you once adored

Time seems to bend

Seem to fade into one empty hole

When my love won't stick to you

Souls that yearn to sing

Teardrop in an eye of infinity

Will spring ever come?

Nothing but a sky with black ashes

Stars fading

Still craving your kiss

Melody haunts my reverie Reverie: a day dream, a state of being
pleasantly lost in

While my heart stands still

I'd make my way back

Stay off the outer darkness

Who knows what hath been buried, until the earth belches it up, and new
eyes are lain upon some old, dank deed

The remains are scattered all over

Every pile of burns that turns up

Grace is gone

Depth of your faith

I'll carry our secrets to our grave if I have to

Desecrating our grave

Do you think I hide my emotions?

I think you bury 'em in the just about the deepest grave I've ever seen

Sweetness in surrendering

Enlighten my eyes Where I shall sleep the sleep of death

Misconstrue: interpret wrongly

Implacable rage Implacable: relentless

What were you running from? Ghosts? Were they in your dreams? Did they
forgive you?

took my beating heart in both her hand and took off quicker than a mare

When the bride who took your breath away becomes the wire who makes you
hole your breath in terror

Stars they dance though late in the night

Above darkened clouds

Smiling at the world from afar

Drove me into an early grave

His nerves gave away

A distant echo

Monsters in my head always knew I'd loose you in the end

Atoms of you atoms of me or atoms of us

Will be a poem

*Title: Medieval rat*

Promise you'll leave without me

Used to being my expectations defiled

Someone else saunters you away

I'm here even when you don't have words to say

Intelligence of the galaxy in essence

Revenge and justice are easy to confuse But you can only choose only one
to refuse

What you did to me; It's only permanent if you chose to let it be

Consciousnesses what let's you know who you are; they remind you of
what's important

I know I'm broken and you're taken I'm not mistaken by this cursed
equation It's never your fault My heart's been fraught Never mistake my
feelings for a grain of salt It's time that I exalt and lock up my vault

Until the, Benefits are manifest Benefits will manifest

Rage is all I have left

All the letters I've penned I believe it's enough for us to mend

A fool thinks himself to be wise But a wise man knows himself to be a
fool

Put a chain around me and it's about who holds the other end

Of the humans brain's myriad design flaws, the hardest to overcome is
attachment; it makes us sentimental.

People abandon all reason for the sake of pride, fear or love.

Entire Starfield just disappeared

I think of you but while you don't even think of me

i dont want to suffer because i'm incapable of withstanding the
heartbreak of love because i'm unhappy i would be wonderful to love you
the way you want to be loved but it's not possible because i'm not a man
i'm a coward evening doesn't console me i see you because i can't see
far i'm getting old time is turning into a thin sheet you can't measure
love in numbers but interms of it's intensity

behind the door there is a hell you built you left me in

This time you just can't fade away into the shadows

But what ending will you make for yourself?

One that starts with a name

Cold heart for a coin

Sunless place

I share my dreams with ghosts

Blood from the mud

Bated breath

No night without stars

Errors unseen

Let us get moving while the stars are still out

A sense of euphoria

The world floated back to me as if in a watery haze

Empty of sorrow

When I fell
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Inspiration v.3

Dream of a thousand cats

Night threaders

Sharp as winter

My choice of lover

From afar, in the dark As the cold water took them

I walk through the wood of ghost

Every step was pain Every movement was torment

Drenched my fur

Why do we do What we do Why do we live As we do?

It was ever thus Thus: as a result or consequence of this; therefore. Or
<span lang="hi-IN">இவ்வாறு</span>, <span lang="hi-IN">இப்படி</span>

Preached in empty places Shouting my message to the stars Whispered in
alleyways

We bare a world that none suffers

Grows fond of the sound of his own voice Or her voice

Footsteps sighs Night is nigh or as the night's nigh

Plague of dreams Nightmares wreaking havoc

Prayers were wasted

Comparing our suffering only compounds it

Even after you call to me After all this time You misunderstand me I owe
you that much

In the darkness He try ought about every story in the star

Paved with time

A Parthenon paved by time

Without forgiveness The wounds will never heal

Tormenting screams of thy forefathers

Price of excellence is eternal vigilance

Exuberance is no excuse Exuberance: the quality of being full of energy,
excitement, and cheerfulness; ebullience.

That's a bell you don't unring

Egress: the action of going out of or leaving a place.

Water flowing

Mettle: <span lang="hi-IN">தைரியம்</span>

When the timer ends

Burning up a star to say goodbye

Fallacy of sunk costs Fallacy: <span lang="hi-IN">தவறு</span>

Though heavens fall

One with a degree more difficulty

Honeydripper

Into every life a rain must fall

# Inspirations v.2

Sound the retreat ''Twas a close call

Tavern tales told of an evening

Old ghosts I showed Shrivelled In darkness

Snare him

Dreams are merely echos of desire and despair

Not the gravity that's holding me down

Vavasour: VAVASOR is a feudal tenant ranking directly below a baron.

Had I been here

Stray dreams toward me

A ghost cannot escape it's fate by hiding in a *dream* or *grief*

Nor can a living human being escape her grief here

without hope, without witness, without reward In darkness we are
revealed

Are you my echo?

She said she was my echo

Prison of the self

Different places different faces

It hurts to grow

I watched them blow away I watched it flow away

Great riches still remain

Seas are blue desert

Following the rain As I drift across a plain

## \# skulking in nightmare

***\## A Flash of Rage***\##

Who is that guy? I think I know. That guy&nbsp;is quite angry though. He was
cross like a dark potato. I watch him pace. I cry hello.

He gives his fist a shake, And screams I've made a bad mistake. The only
other sound's the break, Of distant waves and birds awake.

The guy is destructive, nasty and deep, But he has promises to keep,
Tormented with nightmares he never sleeps. Revenge is a promise a man
should keep.

He rises from his cursed bed, With thoughts of violence in his head, A
flash of rage and he sees red. Without a pause I turned and fled.
------------------------------------------------------------- one night
she sets off into the woods following a fading echo. the story of a
machine and the ghosts we all carry within us

You can't kill an echo

If I run I'll always be afraid

Lull you into false sense of security

Cold that'll freeze the snot right in your nose Wind that'll cut through
your jacket carve your up

Sweet cold wind sweeping off of the lake

**\# loquacious**\# : talkative

He's guilty as sin
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Inspirations v.4

I travel in a world you can't even imagine

Nose deep in devil's dandruff

Until you blithe Blithe: happy or carefree.

Bump on a log

Your lips to god's ears

The death of me

When they failed Seas boiled

Before the dark does

As madness already has him

A path winding Down the mountain

Can't be easy to part with your sorrows

Name yourself stranger

Listen to the wind

Follow my tears Through the wind

Pain we face

Ages come and pass

Winds rose in the mountains of mist

I can tell something's wrong Because hour seems to disappear

Fighting with shadows in your head

Stay in the shadows

The flowers fade

The fire goes out

The shadow creeps

The wind brings me

I'll listen in vain

Leaking dreams

What do you think we might see?
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Inspirations v.5

Land is dry

Faith haven't wavered

Faith in you never wavered

As I turn into godly stardust

Colours fears to tread

Keep your heart open

As my love turns into stardust

As pray migrate away From the drying plains

We're born astride the grave Astride: with a leg on each side of.

Extraneous : irrelevant or unrelated to the subject being dealt with.

Whereupon god smites ye dead

Bloated beyond recognition

Ascribe it to ignorance

Sweep you up in their wakes

Drown my stress in quiet

This isn't where you planned to land when you fell

From the sea into the swirling sky

And through the thunderbolts that took your eye

I take one step, with no regrets

I take two back and that's all again

Overlooked, undermined

I got left out and left behind

You're in hell but you can't even tell

This isn't where you planned to land when you fell

From the sea into the swirling sky

And through the thunderbolts that took your eye

Winters come and the sun hasn't shown his face it all

Those who hearts might just open

All day I've seen versions of how I could end up and I hate them all

Necessity not desire

Reticent: not revealing one's thoughts or feelings readily.

Integrity is the shield to greed and vanity

And by the looks of those ashes

Throwing you a life raft

Patchwork of petty kings

As I Parade in a muddy street As I parade through a/the muddy street

Being set ablaze in my absence

Unfaithful deeds of darkness

Hollow thump or thumping

Search your soul

I don't think the juice is worth the squeeze

A call to worship

Wait for dark

Not thrown in the muck

Unctuous: excessively flattering or ingratiating; oily.

Destined to die in battle

In dead of night Stars in the sky Moonlight in the snow

Ruffian

Give your enemy a length of hope soon they'll be carrying your noose

Will mercy be enough?

What do you seek? What is it that you seek?

My scars tell a good tale

Contrite: feeling or expressing remorse at the recognition that one has
done wrong.

For that I am contrite

When the dawn breaks in

You can't break my heart I was never in love

Dreams in my head I still keep them hidden

Seasons break my heart

Heartaches come and go and all that's left are the words I can't let go.

Acquiescence: reluctant acceptance of something without protest
(agreement, consent or acceptance)

My mind is an empty shell right now

Though he were dead, yet shall he live

Long inured time violence and death Inured: <span lang="hi-IN">காயப்படுத்தப்பட்டது</span>

People ask me of an untimely death

Perhaps not soon enough
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Inspirations v.7

Reaching across the isle

Punching pillow softly

Man I love disappeared

What my mind was Where my kind was Who my mind was (What my mind was)

I remember who I am now

Where can I take you Where you'll just be okay?

We did come to a different world

I lost my breath is all

That'll go unfound for a long time

Summon the shadows of the ancient past

Ever are we bound or blind

Made friends with the ground

Flush the air or ale

Lug you to...

What name do you bear?

Demons you bear To dare

One worth fostering

Strengthen our ties

Something dark happened here We must follow the blood

This story is likely to have poor ending

Cast above the land my friend

Bloodlust

No love lost between you

Shadowed by doubt

Rock and sand in the shallows

Forrest feels different now

Struggles seem pointless

Close your heart for the suffering to come

Your haste will cost us

Trade with the gods

So we're going against the scary singing

Close your heart to it

I alone can never be

We flow into sea water

Wait there while I'll reawaken the light

About the dead

They are poor restless soul denied of their judgement and peace

Plague in a world out of balance

The gods don't care for me much

Eternal war for the light

I will never get used to walking on solid light

More he acquired the more he desired

Ragnarök will be preceded by cruel winters and moral chaos. Giants and
demons approaching from all points of the compass will attack the gods,
who will meet them and face death like heroes. The sun will be darkened,
the stars will vanish, and the earth will sink into the sea. Afterward,
the earth will rise again, the innocent Balder will return from the
dead, and the hosts of the just will live in a hall roofed with gold.

Air grows thin here

Once she was gone lonely ages pass

Beneath his bluster

Against a dead god

I

-   What ails you?

# 

# life is not some stupid centrepiece on the side table of nothingness

Two demons lurk at the edge of the graveyard Can lurk the rest of the
night if necessary

Bugger this for a lark *Lark is a bird google more*

Angel of the bottomless pit Sky's gone red

Be a real feather in your wing

Contemplating on the daily dose of heartbreak

Fermenting dissent and discord

Red sky in the morning Sherpard's warning Sailor's warning

When I'm in off in the stars I won't even think about you

How many angels can dance on the head of the pin?

Let it heal in the sunlight

I look up on your behalf and think of you

what's the point of not being wise if not insane

I ride to where the end of the world begins

Trial of the traitor

Creations shadow

Distant light glimmers Lights that may have been stars

I run away because it makes me stronger But solitude isn't a solution We
all need people Truth is people don't need us

Sentence you to extinction

Betrothed: the person to whom one is engaged.

Worst has happened A blight has begun

Like caterpillars covering the tree

Innocent as the sunrise

Though the day is still young

Blight ends here

Hole in the ocean floor

The faces you can't forget

Clagging chimes of doom

Another life awaits you when you close your eyes

Waking world leaves you wanting and weary

We are bonded over grief We are bonded over sorrows

Summon and imprison death

Why do we confine?

Why do we confine ourselves

Why do we condone

Summon you with pain

Out of loss new love was born

Laid in mud

Currents are stronger and faster

Muster: gather

Sitting out in the rain forever

Think that'll remove the stain

suggest we follow the damned

There's one at the door There's room for one more

Delectation: Delight and Enjoyment

What is it that kills hope?

Stand arrayed

Arrayed: <span lang="hi-IN">வரிசைப்படுத்தப்பட்ட</span>

I got nothing to hide, because you haven't given me a reason to do yet

Saluting a wound

I relate to pain easily than happiness

What's the point of being wise if not insane

Most stories have happy endings Because those who know when to stop

Trouble with stories is that if you keep them going long enough they all
end in death

I offered you a world where you could be yourselves without having to
suffer for it But you seem to enjoy your suffering If that is your truth
perhaps your suffering will set you free

Truth is a cleansing fire which burns away the lies we've told each
other and the lies we've told ourselves

Where there's no good or bad there is only the truth

How am I supposed to see a better world? Shall I close my eyes And
embrace the darkness

Skein: a length of thread or yarn, loosely coiled and knotted.

Reveal the wounds that were hidden That never healed

without hope, without witness, without reward In darkness we are
revealed

Are you my echo?

She said she was my echo

Prison of the self

Different places different faces

It hurts to grow

I watched them blow away I watched it flow away

Great riches still remain

Seas are blue desert

Following the rain As I drift across a plain

## \# skulking in nightmare

***\## A Flash of Rage***\##

Who is that guy? I think I know. That guy&nbsp;is quite angry though. He was
cross like a dark potato. I watch him pace. I cry hello.

He gives his fist a shake, And screams I've made a bad mistake. The only
other sound's the break, Of distant waves and birds awake.

The guy is destructive, nasty and deep, But he has promises to keep,
Tormented with nightmares he never sleeps. Revenge is a promise a man
should keep.

He rises from his cursed bed, With thoughts of violence in his head, A
flash of rage and he sees red. Without a pause I turned and fled.
------------------------------------------------------------- one night
she sets off into the woods following a fading echo. the story of a
machine and the ghosts we all carry within us

You can't kill an echo

If I run I'll always be afraid

Lull you into false sense of security

Cold that'll freeze the snot right in your nose Wind that'll cut through
your jacket carve your up

Sweet cold wind sweeping off of the lake

**\# loquacious**\# : talkative

He's guilty as sin
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Inspirations v.4

I travel in a world you can't even imagine

Nose deep in devil's dandruff

Until you blithe Blithe: happy or carefree.

Bump on a log

Your lips to god's ears

The death of me

When they failed Seas boiled

Before the dark does

As madness already has him

A path winding Down the mountain

Can't be easy to part with your sorrows

Name yourself stranger

Listen to the wind

Follow my tears Through the wind

Pain we face

Ages come and pass

Winds rose in the mountains of mist

I can tell something's wrong Because hour seems to disappear

Fighting with shadows in your head

Stay in the shadows

The flowers fade

The fire goes out

The shadow creeps

The wind brings me

I'll listen in vain

Leaking dreams

What do you think we might see?
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Inspirations v.5

Land is dry

Faith haven't wavered

Faith in you never wavered

As I turn into godly stardust

Colours fears to tread

Keep your heart open

As my love turns into stardust

As pray migrate away From the drying plains

We're born astride the grave Astride: with a leg on each side of.

Extraneous : irrelevant or unrelated to the subject being dealt with.

Whereupon god smites ye dead

Bloated beyond recognition

Ascribe it to ignorance

Sweep you up in their wakes

Drown my stress in quiet

This isn't where you planned to land when you fell

From the sea into the swirling sky

And through the thunderbolts that took your eye

I take one step, with no regrets

I take two back and that's all again

Overlooked, undermined

I got left out and left behind

You're in hell but you can't even tell

This isn't where you planned to land when you fell

From the sea into the swirling sky

And through the thunderbolts that took your eye

Winters come and the sun hasn't shown his face it all

Those who hearts might just open

All day I've seen versions of how I could end up and I hate them all

Necessity not desire

Reticent: not revealing one's thoughts or feelings readily.

Integrity is the shield to greed and vanity

And by the looks of those ashes

Throwing you a life raft

Patchwork of petty kings

As I Parade in a muddy street As I parade through a/the muddy street

Being set ablaze in my absence

Unfaithful deeds of darkness

Hollow thump or thumping

Search your soul

I don't think the juice is worth the squeeze

A call to worship

Wait for dark

Not thrown in the muck

Unctuous: excessively flattering or ingratiating; oily.

Destined to die in battle

In dead of night Stars in the sky Moonlight in the snow

Ruffian

Give your enemy a length of hope soon they'll be carrying your noose

Will mercy be enough?

What do you seek? What is it that you seek?

My scars tell a good tale

Contrite: feeling or expressing remorse at the recognition that one has
done wrong.

For that I am contrite

When the dawn breaks in

You can't break my heart I was never in love

Dreams in my head I still keep them hidden

Seasons break my heart

Heartaches come and go and all that's left are the words I can't let go.

Acquiescence: reluctant acceptance of something without protest
(agreement, consent or acceptance)

My mind is an empty shell right now

Though he were dead, yet shall he live

Long inured time violence and death Inured: <span lang="hi-IN">காயப்படுத்தப்பட்டது</span>

People ask me of an untimely death

Perhaps not soon enough
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Inspirations v.7

Reaching across the isle

Punching pillow softly

Man I love disappeared

What my mind was Where my kind was Who my mind was (What my mind was)

I remember who I am now

Where can I take you Where you'll just be okay?

We did come to a different world

I lost my breath is all

That'll go unfound for a long time

Summon the shadows of the ancient past

Ever are we bound or blind

Made friends with the ground

Flush the air or ale

Lug you to...

What name do you bear?

Demons you bear To dare

One worth fostering

Strengthen our ties

Something dark happened here We must follow the blood

This story is likely to have poor ending

Cast above the land my friend

Bloodlust

No love lost between you

Shadowed by doubt

Rock and sand in the shallows

Forrest feels different now

Struggles seem pointless

Close your heart for the suffering to come

Your haste will cost us

Trade with the gods

So we're going against the scary singing

Close your heart to it

I alone can never be

We flow into sea water

Wait there while I'll reawaken the light

About the dead

They are poor restless soul denied of their judgement and peace

Plague in a world out of balance

The gods don't care for me much

Eternal war for the light

I will never get used to walking on solid light

More he acquired the more he desired

Ragnarök will be preceded by cruel winters and moral chaos. Giants and
demons approaching from all points of the compass will attack the gods,
who will meet them and face death like heroes. The sun will be darkened,
the stars will vanish, and the earth will sink into the sea. Afterward,
the earth will rise again, the innocent Balder will return from the
dead, and the hosts of the just will live in a hall roofed with gold.

Air grows thin here

Once she was gone lonely ages pass

Beneath his bluster

Against a dead god

I

# Inspirations

-   What ails you?

# 

# life is not some stupid centrepiece on the side table of nothingness

Two demons lurk at the edge of the graveyard Can lurk the rest of the
night if necessary

Bugger this for a lark *Lark is a bird google more*

Angel of the bottomless pit Sky's gone red

Be a real feather in your wing

Contemplating on the daily dose of heartbreak

Fermenting dissent and discord

Red sky in the morning Sherpard's warning Sailor's warning

When I'm in off in the stars I won't even think about you

How many angels can dance on the head of the pin?

Let it heal in the sunlight

I look up on your behalf and think of you

what's the point of not being wise if not insane

I ride to where the end of the world begins

Trial of the traitor

Creations shadow

Distant light glimmers Lights that may have been stars

I run away because it makes me stronger But solitude isn't a solution We
all need people Truth is people don't need us

Sentence you to extinction

Betrothed: the person to whom one is engaged.

Worst has happened A blight has begun

Like caterpillars covering the tree

Innocent as the sunrise

Though the day is still young

Blight ends here

Hole in the ocean floor

The faces you can't forget

Clagging chimes of doom

Another life awaits you when you close your eyes

Waking world leaves you wanting and weary

We are bonded over grief We are bonded over sorrows

Summon and imprison death

Why do we confine?

Why do we confine ourselves

Why do we condone

Summon you with pain

Out of loss new love was born

Laid in mud

Currents are stronger and faster

Muster: gather

Sitting out in the rain forever

Think that'll remove the stain

suggest we follow the damned

There's one at the door There's room for one more

Delectation: Delight and Enjoyment

What is it that kills hope?

Stand arrayed

Arrayed: <span lang="hi-IN">வரிசைப்படுத்தப்பட்ட</span>

I got nothing to hide, because you haven't given me a reason to do yet

Saluting a wound

I relate to pain easily than happiness

What's the point of being wise if not insane

Most stories have happy endings Because those who know when to stop

Trouble with stories is that if you keep them going long enough they all
end in death

I offered you a world where you could be yourselves without having to
suffer for it But you seem to enjoy your suffering If that is your truth
perhaps your suffering will set you free

Truth is a cleansing fire which burns away the lies we've told each
other and the lies we've told ourselves

Where there's no good or bad there is only the truth

How am I supposed to see a better world? Shall I close my eyes And
embrace the darkness

Skein: a length of thread or yarn, loosely coiled and knotted.

Reveal the wounds that were hidden That never healed
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Inspiration v.6

The wage of sin is death

Ill humour in the morning brings about a darkened day

Flooding out our forbearers

We may never pass this way again

Until you blithe

Let it slip away

Knock on door

Starting to crack

Today's no day to fall apart

No one dares to find

Sleep with one eye open

Alone out on that open road

When love becomes a sacrifice 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Inspiration v.10

The skies tell us what is to come

Will you fly me to work tomorrow

A soul in a decaying body

For whom the bell tolls

Chasing a fantasy

I’m forcing my delusions on them
Forcing a delusion

Don’t loose too much heart

Befallen

An unnatural glow or flow

What separated life from death?

After all I’ve lost I barely believe in god

An illness to be beaten out of my mind

Death often came before any cure

Horrors that had dominated the mind
Or my mind 

Back when the songs were written

Scattered like the stars in the galaxy

I’ll break her binds with my black knife
( break a bind with a black knife )

World’s full of lonely people afraid to make the first move

A key lies beyond her gaze

Innocent eyes will bleak at dawn, when weakness falls away

When bleakness falls away or apart

Downpour

Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you 

Your path lies that way

withered waif 

Drowning out the memory of her voice

First one to fray

For the voice could blot out the sky and flood the land

Here do we toil

Eyes that were blinded

Eyes that toil

Watch the skies, traveller 

When sea blends with the sky

Edge of the abyss
Is where god works

Frightened nanosecond
